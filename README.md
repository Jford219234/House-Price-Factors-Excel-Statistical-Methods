# Housing Price Factors
Looking at which factors drive home prices.  Ran an A/A test to make sure the data was not biased.  Created pivot tables, ran t-tests and created bar charts to analyze data in excel.  Ran tests to see if the number of bathrooms, fireplaces and the year a house was built factored in to driving house prices. Using the insights from these statistical tests, I created a powerpoint presentation and presented my findings for stakeholders.
